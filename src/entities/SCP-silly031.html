                <b>Special Containment Procedures: </b>
                SCP-silly031 has to be kept in a dark room (or preferably medium sized, well-sealed box) with moderate count of Waffles - which is a main weakness of the entity. Entity should be then neutralized and quite harmless. <br>
                It is recommended to have at least one (1) guard on duty at all times to make sure entity has not ran away. It is discouraged to open the container at any cost, entity will try to leave sounds of sad meow (similar to a common Cat) to lure anybody around and letting said entity out.

        <b>Description: </b>
        SCP-silly031 by it's characteristics looks like common cat entity, with the difference of it's behaviour and posture.
        Entity is able to walk on 2 paws like any humanoid, understands English language quite well and when interacted - very often wants others to be referred as "Niko". 
        Entity can be differenciated from other cat by the sounds it makes, it creates loud, but often called "cute" meowing sounds everytime with different pitch to lure their victims closer to their position. 
        When interacted with, SCP will try to keep the victim for as long as possible within their reach with various tactics such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Loud purring</li>
            <li>Touching victim with paws</li>
            <li>Creating more "cute" meowing sounds</li>
        </ul>
        Said entity after keeping it's victim for enough time - creates very poisonous toxins that first immobilize it's victims and then kill them on a sight. 
        The said toxins are being created usually after five to ten (5-10) minutes since the first victim's interaction with anomaly.

        <b>Note: </b>
        It is STRONGLY not recommended to:
        <ul>
            <li>Take away</li>
            <li>Steal</li>
            <li>Insult</li>
        </ul>
        entities bulb which entity often referrs to as "sun" as anomaly might turn agressive to the others nearby and start creating mentioned toxins sooner.
        <br><br>
        If you see any undocumented here behaviour of anomaly - please refer to <a href="SCP-silly031-A.html">SCP-silly031-A</a> for it's more advanced evolution.
